                        Ultramarine Blue is a pigment commonly used in semi-permanent makeup for creating subtle to bold eyeliner and brow effects. It has a rich blue color ranging from soft powder blue to deep navy blue. One of the benefits of using ultramarine blue pigment is its stability and longevity, which allows it to maintain its vibrant color over time.
